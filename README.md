(not finished)
to show the motion of charged particle (electron,proton,etc) in given magnetic field and electric field
several steps of this code:
    1. set the 3D domian 
    2. set magnetic field & electric field
    3. set the initial particles (velocity and direction)
    4. record and show the information of the particles in given time interval
